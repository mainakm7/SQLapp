**Made an app to store to-do events - ToDoApp**

Uses SQL database to store the to-dos.

Made an user authentication program.

Details: User can make a profile, login and then store their todos in the app. The app can track the todos for each user. It can be modified by the user.

REST Apis for CRUD operations were generated using FastAPI

Using relative module imports for pytest compatibility. Need to run app from root folder outside app package (e.g: root_folder/To-do_list_app)

For the database: SQLITE3 and MYSQL:5.6 were used.
